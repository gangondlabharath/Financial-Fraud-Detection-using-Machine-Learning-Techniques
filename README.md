 # 💸 Financial Fraud Detection in Transactions

This project applies machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent transactions in financial datasets. The aim is to accurately identify suspicious activities to assist banks and payment platforms in preventing fraud.

## 🔍 Features

- Uses real-world or simulated financial transaction data
- Detects fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions (binary classification)
- Implements machine learning models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.
- Handles class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE or under-sampling
- Evaluates performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
